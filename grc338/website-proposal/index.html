					<p>    There is a lot of ice cream in the world, but after 8 years of schooling in the art of The Cream, our founders knew they had the ability to make ice cream like no one had ever tasted before. After years of carefully perfecting every flavor, Icy finally opened its doors on February 29th, 2020. Since then, the public response has become what can only be described as a revolution. Despite having lines out of the door every day since opening, Icy's employees work hard to make sure that all customers get the delicious treat they were promised as quikly as possible.</p><!-- This is a placeholder!
